    <div class="px-36">Weâ€™d like to acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the land on which we meet today,
        the Cabrogal Clan of the Darug Nation and pay my respects to Elders past and present.
        We extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples here today.
        It is also acknowledged that the land was accessed by peoples of the Tharawal and Gandangara Nations.
